Administrator guide - Google drive
==================================

Distribution surveys
--------------------

This way of **distribution** allows you to quickly and easily send the form 
through the Google office platform. 
This method requires that all users (administrator included) have an Google Account. 
Follow the instructions to carry out this process:

1. Create a folder inside of Google Drive

.. image:: /_static/img/collect-odk-v1-administrator-googledrive/image1.*
  :alt: Create folder google drive
  :class: device-screen-vertical side-by-side

2. You must enter inside of the created folder and upload the form 
   e.g.: *aeps_production_event.xml*

.. image:: /_static/img/collect-odk-v1-administrator-googledrive/image2.*
  :alt: Upload form
  :class: device-screen-vertical side-by-side

3. The next step is to share the form with users. 
   To do this we press right click on the form and click on the **Share** option, 
   this will open a new window in which **we must type each of the emails of the users**,
   which will collect data in field.
