Guide
-----

In order to users can take advantage of this guide, we explain
what should be the *step by step* to configure the platform.

1. **Install**: You have to install the website in order to create the first user.

2. **Manage user**: You should create all users which are available
   to work in the platform. Users can sigin in the website in order to configure
   parameters and see dashboards about information.

3. **Configure forms**: Once users have been created, you should
   create the forms. A form is the structure how the data will be organized.
   You can import *XLS Form* or *Create a new form*, both have their implications
   that you will see in the next chapters.

4. **Setup additional parameters**: Additional parameters are some global configurations
   which affects reports.

5. **Visualize dashboards**: Depending of the platform selected to visualize information,
   Some dashboards have been design to display information about *crop performance* and
   *collect performance*.
